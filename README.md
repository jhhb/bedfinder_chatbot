### Recovery house chatbot to find beds

This project began on Wednesday, August 23, 2017 as part of Boston Digital Health
Innovators as a away of empowering people struggling with opiate addiction to easily find
openings in addiction recovery centers.

This app comes pretty directly from Facebook's Chatbot API and, once completed as a proof of concept, will be
marketed to addiction recovery centers to plug into other Boston Digital Health Innovators-supplied EMR APIs.
